' TB - test 256 x 256 icon - not working from form

' TB - convert all RC collections to TB collections, TB can load PNGs to a TB standard collection, comaprison

' TB - convert all dictionary.scripting collections used in timers to a TB standard collection as it is faster than a dictionary.scripting collection

' update PZ CPU RC6 to same standard, timers, collections &c

' test the icon sizes on 32bit Win7, XP and ReactOS, find out if 48x48 causes a crash
' 32x32 (24 bit)
' 16x16 (24 bit)
' 48x48 (32 bit)
' 32x32 (32 bit)
' 16x16 (32 bit)

' test on 32bit win 7
' test on XP
' test on ReactOS

' if any newer, Vista + API code fails on VB6 then we can start by adding some API checks and removing functionality

' windevlib - observe, test and determine whether to use within TB version, implications WIP

' colouring new control
' html help and images updated
' chm help built
' test autostart
' initial github synch.
' readme.md created and updated with new images

' smooth pointer - flick/smooth - done
' sampling interval vars - done
' sampling interval var validation - done
' sampling interval var reading/writing - done

' add sleep timer  - done

' closing via menu - done
' save position correctly - done

' renamed the restart.exe to make it less generically-named and worrying to a/v tools
' mouseDown on the gauge disables sampling timer and improves responsiveness.
' restarted timers on mouseUp
' add the test and error message for RC6 DLL registration

'    All occurrences of PzG switched to gbl
'    DPI switch moved to subroutine to tidy up
'    preference load moved to subroutine to tidy up
'    form resize event created for modification when subclassing in the future
'    twinbasic message loop changes for TwinBasic
'    glbcoding environment changes throughout for TwinBasic
'    editor globals definition and usage throughout for TwinBasic
'    addTargetFile source path empty then uses current app.path
'    All TwinBasic changes implemented as per clock/calendar
'    Tidy mainRoutine in modMain

'    prefs subclassing for resize on WM_EXITMOVED
'    Form_Resize
'
'    dual automatic monitor sizing changes
'    prefs balloon tooltips on all controls
'    resizing using subclassing
'    github home menu link

' visual styles = false removed from labels and images
' Gutter fixed
' mz Tools code analysis
' rubberduck

' fixed the zoom proportion to use the tenshillings widget zoom and not the widgetroot zoom factor
' prefs calls new sub for saving the current ratios for the RC form and the absolute sizes for the Prefs form
' saves the current ratios for the RC form when resizing using mousewheel
' removed unwanted positioning code
' renamed some subs to better suit their function

' help CHM
' setup2go create setup.exe

' The tooltip bug where the tooltip shape and background are different, visual styles = false removed from labels and images, removed the manifest to obtain normal styles

' mz Tools code analysis

' update the setup 2go

' rubberduck 10/-

' test prefs form size on a first start, should be 0.5 on a screen that is bigger than twice the form height

' setup2go create setup.exe

' create and test TB version

' test high DPI on 1st startup

' test DPI awareness on multiple monitors, with a manifest, allows interception of the WM_DPICHANGED message which then allows the code to be called
'   that can auto-scale the whole form. This requires auto-scaling being enabled per monitor with different scaling on each screen.

' enable save button after a prefs form resize
' "surround" code in resize - remove

' fix on call to save prefs to prevent setfocus error when not visible

' fixing the wrong form size at prefs startup
' ensure the save button is disabled during startup
' moved monitor test to occur after the prefs form positioning

' determine how to identify the screen intersection point using WM_MOVING - tested, too slow to resize all controls on all forms, abandoned the idea.
' disable the 'save button' after an auto-resize by positionPrefsMonitor
' inserting a 256 bit icon into the VB6 binary using VBAdvance
' frame around the prefs icon group - invisible during drag then visible on completion.

' widgetprefs - moved timers into a non-visible frame
' widget & widget properties in cwhelp.cls spread out
' Ensure the heights of forms are saved correctly after a resize, sometimes you need to let the background timer make the save before it 'sticks'.

' module1.bas globals renamed, eg. gbl to gblS gblL &c and tested.
' other modules globals renamed, eg. gbl to gblS gblL &c and tested.
' module1.bas globals to properties? 

' r/h and bottom gutter width resolved
' removed lots of redundant commented out code
' remove ltrim$ where not needed
' added cstr() to some numeric to string coercions

' resize controls error when testing on windows 11  messagebox
' message box too small
' XML generated
' installer generated

' prevent the multi-core form and timers from auto-loading and operating at startup
' ensure all the CPU timers exit when a flag is set to TRUE, after a click on the gauge
' New in-code timers to replace the RC5 timers, about, help and licence
' Convert the RC5 sampling and animation timers to new in-code timers, als…
' change to the interval property LET, now stops and restarts the timer affected
' Reduce CPU usage during mouse hover
o in bubbling event, tooltip creation,  remove the reference to a function to extract the CPU information
o put the call to that function in the 3 second sampler instead
o access that data via a global variable/property
o in bubbling event, tidy the tooltip code
o renamed all global converted property vars to reflect new naming convention
' convert latest to TB
