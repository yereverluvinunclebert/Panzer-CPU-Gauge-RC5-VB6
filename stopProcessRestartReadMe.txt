Just in case your A/V tool flags this as a virus or potential malware - it isn't.
The main program has an option to restart itself by a HARD restart. A binary doesn't have that capability by itself so it has a helper program to restart the main program.
That is the purpose of stopProcessRestart.exe. 

You san find the program source code for this program here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Restart-Helper-VB6, compile it yourself, rename it and test - then stop Worrying!!
